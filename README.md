# online_souq

A Souq is an outdoor marketplace full of vegetables, spices, old books, textiles and all kinds of wonderful goodies. You have been tasked with writing code for one of the first online outdoor marketplaces that will help Souq vendors get their goods out to the world!

We can use an array to store the contents of our cart in a variable called souq_cart. Write a program that does the following:

Greet the shopper and take their name. Store this as name.
Ask the user what they want to add to their shopping cart. Here is kicker. They must ask for something from the following items. Programmers like to start out small before moving into more complex things, so the list of possible items is small! Here is a list of possible items they can choose from. If they are not on the list, the user should be notified so:
* old paperback book
* potato
* red onion
* dried lemon
* frankincense
* medicinal herbs
* saffron
* glass spice jar
* red fabric
* orange fabric
* handicrafts
* small Persian rug
* medium Persian rug
* large Persian rug
* extra large Persian rug
Give the user an option to type a command like "FINISHED" which stops the user from getting asked to add more items.
If they entered an item, store that item in the the cart.
Once finished, print out the contents of the cart of the user to see in the following format (name here is "Elon"):
Elon, thanks for trying our online Souq platform. Here is a list of the items in
your cart!:

* handicrafts
* saffron
* medicinal herbs
* orange fabric
* extra large Persian rug

Part 2 - Refine your storefront

Update your program from Part 1 to store another variable of items that the user entered but couldn't be in the cart. The output of your program should be something like the following:

Elon, thanks for trying our online Souq platform. Here is a list of the items in
your cart!:

* handicrafts
* saffron
* medicinal herbs
* orange fabric
* extra large Persian rug

Btw, we noticed you tried entering in some items that aren't part of the online
Souq. We don't have the following items yet but will let you know if they show
up!:

* toothpaste
* sandwich
* fake bear fur
* siffron
* ornj fabrik
